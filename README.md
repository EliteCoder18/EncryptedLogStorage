# EncryptedLogStorage
# LogPin

**Secure, encrypted log archiving using IPFS and blockchain-backed immutability.**

---

## Overview

**LogPin** is a Python-based pipeline that:

1. **Encrypts system/application logs** and saves them as PDF.
2. Uploads the encrypted PDF to **IPFS** for decentralized, permanent storage.
3. Stores the **IPFS CID (hash) on the blockchain** to ensure immutability and verifiable proof of existence.

This project is designed for research and practical applications where logs need to be:

* Securely stored
* Tamper-proof
* Decentralized and recoverable

---

##  Features

* **Encryption-first**: Logs are encrypted before upload for data privacy.
* **Decentralized storage**: Uses IPFS to store logs permanently.
* **Immutable hash storage**: Stores the IPFS CID on the blockchain for tamper-proof, verifiable logging.
* **Python-powered**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend.

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Python** (processing, encryption, IPFS upload, blockchain interaction)
* **IPFS** (via Pinata)
* **Blockchain** (Sepolia Ethereum testnet currently)
* **PDF Encryption** (`PyPDF2`, `reportlab`)

## Getting Started

1 **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LogPin.git
cd LogPin
```

2 **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3 **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file:

```
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_key
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret
BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_project_id
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
```

4 **Run the pipeline:**

```bash
python log_encryptor.py
python ipfs_uploader.py
python blockchain_pusher.py
```
